          <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&rsquo;ll be no one to stop us this time! Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&rsquo;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
          <p>As you wish. Your eyes can deceive you. Don&rsquo;t trust them. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Don&rsquo;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&rsquo;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
          <li>I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</li>
          <li>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</li>
          <li>You don&rsquo;t believe in the Force, do you?</li>
          <li>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&rsquo;t trust them. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I&rsquo;m trying not to, kid. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is.</p>
          <p>As you wish. You don&rsquo;t believe in the Force, do you? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&rsquo;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&rsquo;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
          <ol>
          <li>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</li>
          <li>Red Five standing by.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I&rsquo;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Still, she&rsquo;s got a lot of spirit. I don&rsquo;t know, what do you think? As you wish.</p>

          <p><p>I call it luck. Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
          <p>You don&rsquo;t believe in the Force, do you? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is. But with the blast shield down, I can&rsquo;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li>
          <li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I find your lack of faith disturbing. As you wish. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
          <p>Red Five standing by. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? What?! Ye-ha! He is here.</p>
          <ol>
          <li>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</li>
          <li>As you wish.</li>
          <li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&rsquo;re going. I find your lack of faith disturbing. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Don&rsquo;t be too proud of this technological terror you&rsquo;ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Don&rsquo;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&rsquo;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
